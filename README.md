# Internet-Movie-Database

I have replicated the IMDB database by designing a Toad Model using Toad Data Modeller 6.1 and queried the data in Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Management Studio and Oracle SQL Developer 4.1.3
I have added new features like in-house ticketing and included information about various theaters screening the movies.
I have also included awards feature and included nominees.
I have implemented procedures, functions and triggers in Microsoft SQL server to display answers to 21 queries useful to the IMDB users.
I have also inserted data into Hive database.
